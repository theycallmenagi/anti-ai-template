# AO3 Anti-AI Template

This is a copy/paste-safe HTML structure for Archive of Our Own (AO3) fanfiction authors to discourage AI scraping while keeping content readable and accessible to human readers.

## How to Use

1. Copy the contents of `template.html`
2. Paste into your AO3 work (in HTML view)
3. Add your story text where marked
4. Lock your fic to registered users for extra protection
